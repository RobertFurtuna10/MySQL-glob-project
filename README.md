# MySQL-glob-project

## Introduction
- In this project I created a database named globe which includes several continents, countries, cities and people from all over the world to run different queries and instructions.
- I wanted the database to have 4 tables with the following names: tara, orase, limba, persoane
- the types of data used were mostly int, not null, auto_increment, date, varchar or primary key
- instruction used from DDL category: create database, create table, primary key, foreign key, alter table
- instruction used from DML category: insert into tables
- instruction used from DQL category: select (from, where, between, and, on)
